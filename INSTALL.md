#JavaMOP INSTALL

Here are instructions for installing JavaMOP from the release zip
archive. Users who checked out the sources should follow the
instructions in src/README.md to build JavaMOP.

##Prerequisites

To use JavaMOP you need JRE, AJC and RV-Monitor.

1. JRE

 Java Runtime Environment version 7 or higher (http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp)

* To make sure java is installed properly, run `java -version` from a
  terminal.

2. AJC

 AspectJ Compiler version 1.8.1 or higher
 (http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/downloads.php)

 * Make sure that `<Path-to-AspectJ_HOME>/bin` is in your `PATH` by
   calling `ajc` in a terminal.

 * Also ensure that `<Path-to-AspectJ_HOME>/lib/aspectjrt.jar`,
   `<Path-to-AspectJ_HOME>/lib/aspectjweaver.jar` and
   `<Path-to-AspectJ_HOME>/lib/aspectjtools.jar` are in your
   CLASSPATH.

3. RV-Monitor

 The RV-Monitor libraries. (https://www.runtimeverification.com/monitor)

 1. Download RV-Monitor installer from the rv-monitor website
 mentioned above and follow the instructions on that website to
 install it to your desired directory.

 2. Add `<path-to-rvmonitorrt.jar>` and `<path-to-rvmonitor.jar>` to
 your CLASSPATH. In the current version of RV-Monitor, those jars are
 in the `lib/` directory which is located inside the directory to
 which RV-Monitor was installed, and are named,
 rv-monitor-${version}.jar and
 rvmonitorrt-${version}.jar, respectively.

##Install

1. Download JavaMOP's binary from [its website]
(http://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/index.php/JavaMOP4).

2. Unzip the file to your preferred location.

##Use

`<path-to-javamop>/bin/javamop` is the target binary. For convenient
usage, update your `PATH` environment variable with
`<path-to-javamop>/bin/`.

For information on how to use JavaMOP, please refer to the README.md
