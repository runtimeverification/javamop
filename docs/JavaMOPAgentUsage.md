# JavaMOPAgent Documentation

## Prerequisites

1. Running JavaMOPAgent, requires the installation and use of
[JavaMOP](https://github.com/runtimeverification/javamop) and
[RV-Monitor](https://runtimeverification.com/monitor/1.3/docs/).

2. Currently, JavaMOPAgent does not support multiple .aj input files.
A single .aj file can be generated from multiple multiple property
files by running JavaMOP with ```-merge``` option (see example below).

3. All the monitor libraries (.java files) generated by RV-Monitor
should be contained in a single directory (see the example below).

## Building and Using a JavaMOP Agent

### Building a JavaMOP Agent

The following command can be used to build agents for runtime
instrumentation of applications:

`javamopagent <AJ-File> <Monitor-Lib-Dir> [-n <agent name>] [-excludeJars]`

The required ```<AJ-File>``` option specifies the path to the single
AspectJ file (generated by JavaMOP) from which the agent will be
built. ```<Monitor-Lib-Dir>``` is the directory containing all monitor
library files (generated by RV-Monitor). ```[-n <agent name>]```
optionally allows the user to specify the name of the generated
agent. The optional ```[-excludeJars]``` option will prevent jars for
the RV-Monitor runtime and AspectJ Weaver from being included in the
generated agent -- the user will the have to manually include those
jars in the CLASSPATH before running the agent.

### Example of Building an Agent

The following procedure shows how to build an agent from two .mop files
on a Unix-like system:

1. ```git clone https://github.com/runtimeverification/javamop.git```

2. ```mvn package```

3. ```cd examples/agent/many/rvm/cfg```. This directory contains two
property files: SafeFile.mop and SafeFileWriter.mop.

4. Generate the single .aj file and .rvm files from the properties (
   After this step, these files will be generated:
   `MultiSpec_1MonitorAspect.aj`, `SafeFile.rvm` and `SafeFileWriter.rvm`):

	```javamop -merge *.mop```

5. Create directories for storing the monitor libraries:

	```mkdir -p classes/mop```

6. Generate the monitor libraries using RV-Monitor:

	```rv-monitor -merge -d classes/mop/ *.rvm```

	After this step, ```MultiSpec_1RuntimeMonitor.java``` will be generated in 
	folder ```classes/mop```. 

7. (Optional) Compile the monitor library file and remove Java file:

	```javac classes/mop/MultiSpec_1RuntimeMonitor.java```
	
	```rm classes/mop/MultiSpec_1RuntimeMonitor.java```

8. Build a JavaMOP agent which does not contain AspectJ Weaver and
RV-Monitor jars:

	```javamopagent MultiSpec_1MonitorAspect.aj classes -n JavaMOPAgent -excludeJars```

After step 8, ```JavaMOPAgent.jar``` will be created in the current
directory and can be used for runtime monitoring, as explained
below.

### Using a Java Agent

An agent, "JavaMOPAgent.jar", built as described in the previous
section, can be used in the following ways:

1. For projects with a well-defined entry point, such as a Main class,
   first compile the source code and then run the following command:

   ```java -javaagent:JavaMOPAgent.jar Main```

   In other words, you will need to run the same command as you would
   normally use for running your Java application, but with the
   addition of the ```-javaagent:JavaMOPAgent.jar```, as shown above.


2. For Maven-based projects with tests, you can modify ```pom.xml```
to use the agent when running tests by adding following lines:

  ```xml
    <build>
    	<plugins>
    		...
        	<plugin>
	  		<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
	  		<artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
	  		<version>${surefire-version}</version>
	  		<configuration>
        			<argLine>-javaagent:JavaMOPAgent.jar</argLine>
	  		</configuration>
        	</plugin>
		...
      	</plugins>
     </build>
   ```

   Replace ```${surefire-version}``` with the exact surefire plugin
   version used by the project (e.g., 2.16).

   After that, you can run tests as usual with the ```mvn test```
   command. The execution of the tests will now be monitored by the
   agent.

3. For Ant-based projects with tests, you can modify ```build.xml```
   to use the agent when running tests by adding one line under the
   ```junit``` task:

  ```xml
    <target name=...>
    	<junit ...>
    		...
        	<jvmarg value="-javaagent:JavaMOPAgent.jar"/>
		...
      	</plugins>
     </target>
   ```

   After that, you can run tests as usual with the ```ant
   ${test_target_name}``` command. The execution of the tests will now
   be monitored by the agent.

4. A java agent can be easily integrated into IDEs like IntelliJ,
Eclipse, etc.
   
   For IntelliJ:
   click the "Run" tab 
             -> select the "Edit Configurations" tab 
             -> select the application you are running 
             -> select "configuration" tab 
             -> enter "javaagent:JavaMOPAgent.jar" in the "VM options" textbox. 
   
   For Eclipse:
   click "Run" tab 
         -> select "Run configurations" tab 
         -> select the application you are running 
         -> select "Arguments" tab 
         -> enter "javaagent:JavaMOPAgent.jar" into "VM options" textbox.
   
   By doing this, you will be able to run or debug programs with the
   agent within your IDE.
