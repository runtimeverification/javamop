# JavaMOP Usage

**Note:** This document assumes that you have followed all
the instructions in [../INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md) and updated
your CLASSPATH and PATH environment variables according to the
Prerequisites section in that file.
In addition, be cautious whenever you modify or override the
CLASSPATH as it might break the prerequisites of JavaMOP.

Before using JavaMOP, you should specify the properties to be
monitored. The specifications must be stored in files with `.mop`
extension (e.g. `HasNext.mop`).

# Modes of use

JavaMOP currently supports two modes of use:

1. Java Agent

  Java [agents]
  (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html)
  make it possible to instrument programs running on the JVM. This
  option is the easiest one to use: AspectJ Compiler (ajc) is not
  needed and all the dependencies are contained within the
  agent. However, using this option may incur more runtime overhead,
  since it weaves the code at runtime.

2. Static Weaving

  Compared to the Java Agent option, Static Weaving has better
  performance, but it requires knowledge of using ajc and resolving
  all the target program's dependencies.

(For a description of all JavaMOP options, please run the following
from a terminal at any time: `javamop -h`)

### Building and using a Java Agent

#### Building a Java Agent

With this mode, you may build Java agents for runtime instrumentation
of your applications. Once JavaMOP is correctly installed, this can
be achieved by running the following command:

```javamop -agent [-n <agent name>] [-v] [-d <target directory>] <properties>```

The optional ```[-n <agent name>]``` specifies the name of
the agent generated, ```[-v]``` generates the agent in verbose mode
and ```[-d <target directory>]``` stores all intermediate files from
agent generation in a user specified directory which must exist prior
to issuing the command above. ```<properties>``` refers to one or more
property (i.e. *.mop) files, or a directory containing such property
files.

If you specify the ```[-n <agent name>]``` option, the previous command
will create ```<agent name>.jar``` in the same directory as that from which
the command is run. If a ```[-n <agent name>]``` is not specified and there is
just one specification, then an agent with the same name as the
specification will be generated. Finally, if ```[-n <agent name>]``` is not
specified and there are multiple specification files, then an agent
called "MultiSpec_1.jar" will be generated.

Regarding the properties for building an agent, you can either choose
to write your own properties or use the properties that we have
already formalized from Java API. If you decide to write your own
properties, you need to declare those properties to be in `package
mop;` This is because JavaMOP is using some internal helper classes
inside that package in the process. (It is not necessary for the
property file(s) to be physically placed inside a directory called
"mop"; all that is required is to make the statement, "package mop;"
to be the first line in the property file). Please refer to [JavaMOP
syntax] (http://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/index.php/JavaMOP4_Syntax) page
for more information on writing your own property files.

We have formalized a large number of properties from the Java API. If
you are interested in building a Java agent to monitor all these
properties, please run the following command:

```javamop -agent [-n <agent name>] [-v] [-d <target directory>]
-usedb```

The ```-usedb``` option fetches our properties (formalized from the
Java API) from this URL:

`https://github.com/runtimeverification/property-db/tree/master/annotated-java-api/java`

Using ```-usedb``` requires an internet connection and will ensure
that you get the latest version of these properties. The first time
the above command is run, it makes a copy of the properties
directory. That way, subsequent runs from the same directory do not
require an internet connection, unless the properties directory is
deleted.

As a separate step, we also encourage the reader to manually download
the properties from the URL given above, place them in a separate
folder and generate an agent with the command:

```javamop -agent [-n <agent name>] [-v] [-d <target directory>]
<properties>```,

where ```<properties>``` is replaced with the directory where the
reader has stored the properties. It may also be educational to open a
few of the ```.mop``` files to learn how to write JavaMOP properties.

#### Using a Java Agent

Assuming that an agent called "JavaMOPAgent.jar" has been built using
any of the commands from the previous section, such an agent may be
run as follows:

1. For projects with a well-defined entry point such as a Main class,
   first compile the source code and then run the following command:

   ```java -javaagent:JavaMOPAgent.jar Main```

   In other words, you will need to run the same command as you would
   normally use for running your Java application, but with the
   addition of the ```-javaagent:JavaMOPAgent.jar```, as shown above.


2. For Maven-based projects with tests, you can modify ```pom.xml```
to use the agent when running tests by adding following lines:

  ```xml
    <build>
    	<plugins>
    		...
        	<plugin>
	  		<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
	  		<artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
	  		<version>${surefire-version}</version>
	  		<configuration>
        			<argLine>-javaagent:JavaMOPAgent.jar</argLine>
	  		</configuration>
        	</plugin>
		...
      	</plugins>
     </build>
   ```

   Replace ```${surefire-version}``` with the exact surefire plugin
   version used by the project (e.g., 2.16).

   After that, you can run tests with the agent as usual by using
   ```mvn test```.

3. For Ant-based projects which have tests, you can modify
   ```build.xml``` to use the agent when running tests by adding one
   line under the ```junit``` task:

  ```xml
    <target name=...>
    	<junit ...>
    		...
        	<jvmarg value="-javaagent:JavaMOPAgent.jar"/>
		...
      	</plugins>
     </target>
   ```

   After that, you can run tests with the agent as usual by using
   ```ant ${test_target_name}```.

4. Java agent is easily integrated into IDEs like IntelliJ, Eclipse,
etc.
   
   For IntelliJ:
   click the "Run" tab 
             -> select the "Edit Configurations" tab 
             -> select the application you are running 
             -> select "configuration" tab 
             -> enter "javaagent:JavaMOPAgent.jar" in the "VM options" textbox. 
   
   For Eclipse:
   click "Run" tab 
         -> select "Run configurations" tab 
         -> select the application you are running 
         -> select "Arguments" tab 
         -> enter "javaagent:JavaMOPAgent.jar" into "VM options" textbox.
   
   By doing this, you will be able to run or debug programs with the
   agent within your IDE.
   

#### Agent generation examples

To build an agent and run it using one of the examples that shipped
with JavaMOP, run following commands from the same directory as in
this example:


```
cd examples/agent/many
javamop -agent -n JavaMOPAgent rvm/
javac SafeMapIterator_1.java
java -javaagent:JavaMOPAgent.jar SafeMapIterator_1
```

Note that running ```javamop -agent -n JavaMOPAgent rvm/``` as above
will print the specification used for building the agent, and print
out message "JavaMOPAgent.jar is generated." at the end, which
indicates everything goes well.

Also, running ```java -javaagent:JavaMOPAgent.jar SafeMapIterator_1```
as above will run the specified Java program and, if everything works,
will print out the following messages:

```
unsafe iterator usage!
unsafe iterator usage!
! hasNext() has not been called before calling next() for an iterator
java found the problem too
```

### Static Weaving Using AspectJ

#### Generating Instrumentation File and Java Library

With this mode, you can generate an instrumentation (.aj) file and a
Java library (.java) file to be weaved into the target program. The
instrumentation file includes the pointcuts and advice which will be
used by ajc to instrument the code. The advice in the instrumentation
file will call the functions provided in the Java library. For
simplicity, JavaMOP appends the Java library file to the
instrumentation file and generates a single .aj file in the end. Once
JavaMOP is correctly installed, this can be achieved by running the
following command:

```javamop [-v] [-d <target directory>] [-merge] <properties>```

The option ```[-v]``` generates the file and the library in verbose
mode and ```[-d <target directory>]``` stores all output files to the
user-specified directory which must exist prior to issuing the command
above.  ```<properties>``` refers to one or more property (i.e. *.mop)
files, or a directory containing such property files. By default, one
.aj file is generated for each JavaMOP specification. When
```[-merge]``` is set, JavaMOP will generate a combined .aj file for
monitoring multiple properties simultaneously.

#### Weaving the code using ajc

To weave the target program with the generated monitoring library, run
the following command:

```ajc -1.6  -d <target directory> <aj file path> <java file path>```

```-1.6``` indicates the output bytecode version. ```-d <target
directory>``` specifies the directory to which the weaved code will be
stored. Note that you must specify the output directory explicitly so
that ajc can put the binary code in the right place. Without ```-d```,
ajc will output all the bytecode files in the current directory,
failing to keep the necessary package layout. You can simply use ```-d
.``` to output binary code in the current
directory. ```<aj file path>``` and ```<java file path>``` refer
to the path to the generated instrumentation file and the path to the
target program (i.e the program to be weaved) respectively. Given this
command, ajc will instrument and compile the original Java file and
store the generated .class file(s) in ```<target directory>```. If
there is no error reported, you can directly run the weaved code in
the ```<target directory>```.

#### Running the Weaved Code
To run the weaved program, simply type:

```java Main```

where `Main` is assumed to be the entry point to the application.

##Troubleshooting

Here we gathered some problems that you might encounter while
using JavaMOP, along with instructions on how to
solve them.

### I get `Code size too big` error when using AspectJ Compiler, what should I do?

In some extreme cases when you need to monitor classes with huge
methods or the intended pointcuts are very dense in some method, you
may encounter some error while using the standard AspectJ compiler to
weave code; as follows:

`/YourBigClass.java [error] problem generating method YourBigClass.bigMethod: Code size too big: 65613.` 

This error is caused by Java's 64KB maximum method size constraint.
If a method of the monitored class is already too big, then, after
inserting the advice at the pointcuts, it may exceed the 64KB
limit. This error has nothing to do with JavaMOP, it is caused by
AspectJ's limitation. 

This kind of problem often happens when you try to weave the bytecode
(.class files) and aspects. If you have access to the source code 
(.java files) of the program that you want to monitor, then the easiest
way that is likely to solve this problem is weaving the source code
(.java files) instead of weaving the compiled code (.class files).
AspectJ compiler will do some optimization to the source code to make it
more space-efficient so that the method size may reduce to the safe zone.

In case you encounter such problem, but either you do not have access to
the source code, or, the above method does not work, then we also provide
a patch for the standard AspectJ source code to solve this problem. 
Please follow the instructions below to install the patch (Please backup
your AspectJ before applying the patch):

**Prerequisites for using the patch:**
 
* AspectJ Compiler source code.

  If you have not checked out the source code of AspectJ, you can go
  [here](http://git.eclipse.org/c/aspectj/org.aspectj.git) to check
  it out.
  
* Ant.

  If you do not have Ant installed, then go
  [here](http://ant.apache.org/) to download and install the latest
  version.

1. Go to your local AspectJ git repository, and checkout the commit
`Fix 443355: interface super references` by executing the command
below (You may need to pull to get the latest updates before you can
perform the operation below):

	``git checkout dddd1236cd21982a07f887ff7fa5d484ebc3b86c``

2. Download the `stdAJC_dddd123.patch` from 
[here](http://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/downloads/stdAJC_dddd123.patch),
and place the patch file in the above AspectJ repository's top level.

3. Apply the patch by executing:

	``git apply --whitespace=nowarn stdAJC_dddd123.patch``
	
4. Build the AspectJ project using ant. You can execute the command
``ant`` at the top level of the AspectJ repository.

5. Deploy the AspectJ libraries. If the previous step is successful,
there will be a new folder called `aj-build` appearing at the top
level of the repository. Add all the jar files in
`<path-to-AspectJ-repository>/aj-build/dist/tools/lib` to your
CLASSPATH.

After generating the new AspectJ libraries and deploying them, your
AspectJ compiler should now be able to handle the classes with huge
methods.

### I get error when I use `Xbootclasspath`, what should I do ?

Instrumenting with Xbootclasspath can lead to errors if the right
jar files are not passed to the Java command after weaving. 
For example, one may see the following error message when 
running something with Xbootclasspath:

	Error occurred during initialization of VM
	java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: sun.misc.JavaLangAccess.registerShutdownHook(ILjava/lang/Runnable;)V
    		at java.io.Console.<clinit>(Console.java:493)
    		at sun.misc.Unsafe.ensureClassInitialized(Native Method)
    		at sun.misc.SharedSecrets.getJavaIOAccess(SharedSecrets.java:93)
    		at java.lang.System.initializeSystemClass(System.java:1089)
    		
The minimum necessary (for JDK 1.6.0.24 on a Linux OS) is

`-Xbootclasspath/p:directoryWithInstrumentedJRE:/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.24/jre/lib/rt.jar`

### I get `Could not find or load main class` error when I use `java`, what should I do ?

This document assumes that you have "." in your CLASSPATH (which is almost always the case). If you do not have it, add it to your CLASSPATH and run that command agian. 

### I get errors when I use `java` or `ajc` with `-cp` (or `-classpath`) option, what should I do ?

JavaMOP (and the files it generates) depend on certain libraries to be on your CLASSPATH. `-cp` and `-classpath` options override your CLASSPATH. So make sure to include the old CLASSPATH in your new one.

### I did not find a solution to my problem here, what should I do ?
