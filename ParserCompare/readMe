This two files record the method calls from javamop's parser and rv-monitor's parser during analyzing spec files respectively.
It is easy to notice that there exists a large amount of overlap. Well, they almost overlap with each other entirely in the first ten method calls, the only difference is their package names!
 
Given the fact that the rv-monitor's parser are extracted from javamop's by copy and paste, we can guess that the functionality performed by them are exactly the same.
In the next few days, I'll try to test whether replacing the function calls in javamop by the lib in rv-monitor will break the integrity and cause bugs.

If there is no evidence showing my hypothesis is wrong, I'll write a simple program to replace all the function calls within javamop's parser with lib calls to rv-monitor. It will be a large amount of work and I do not think it is a good idea to replace them line by line manually.
